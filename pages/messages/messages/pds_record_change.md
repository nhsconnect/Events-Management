summary: "The PDS Record Change event"
---

The `PDS Record Change` event message is generated and published by the Spine, when a change is made to a patient record within the Patient Demographics Service (PDS). The event message will not contain all the PDS information, as the event message is only intended to be a notification that the referenced patient record has changed which allows the subscriber to trigger their PDS synchronisation processes.

Any change to a patients PDS record will trigger the publication of this event, some example of changes that would trigger this event are:

- The NHS Number on the record being superseded
- Changes to demographic information
- Changes to contact details
- Application/Removal of S-Flags, I-Flags

## Onward Delivery 

The delivery of the PDS Record Change event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following WorkflowID within the MESH control file. This WorkflowID will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received. 

| MESH WorkflowID | PDS_RECORD_CHANGE_1 |


## Resource Population Guidance 


### [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)

The Bundle resource is the container for the event message and SHALL conform to the [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle) FHIR profile.

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | 1..1 | Fixed value: `message` |


### [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1)

The MessageHeader resource included as part of the event message SHALL conform to the [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |

| extension(routingDemographics) | 1..1 | The extension MUST contain the details of the patient who is the focus of this event message. |
| extension(routingDemographics).extension(nhsNumber) | 1..1 | The extension MUST contain the patient’s NHS Number identifier and is used by the NEMS for routing event messages to subscribers. |
| extension(routingDemographics).extension(name) | 1..1 | The extension MUST contain the human name element containing the patient’s official names as recognised by PDS, and match the NHS number in the routingDemographics extension. |

| focus | 1..1 | This will reference the focus “Patient” resource. |

**Note:** Where the event message relates to a PDS record being superseded by another, the patient details included in the event will be for the record which is being superceeded rather than the record which is superseding it.


### [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)

This Patient resource included in the event message SHALL conform to the [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| target | 1..1 | The target will reference the Patient resource |
| recorded | 1..1 | The date and time the change was made to the record |
| agent | 1..* | The agent which performed the change to the PDS record |
| agent.whoReference | 1..1 | This will reference the agent who updated the record.<br/><br/>When this is a citizen updating their own PDS record this will reference the Patient resource in the event message.<br/><br/>Otherwise this will be the organisation who updated the event message, with reference to the ODS API. |
