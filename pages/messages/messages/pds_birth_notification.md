summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the PDS Birth Notification event message bundle"
---

PDS Birth Notification event messages are generated by the Spine and published to the NEMS when a birth is registered on PDS. The event message will contain the details of the mothers, the details of the baby and some supporting information around the birth as per the guidance on this page.


## Bundle structure

Specifies mandatory referencing within the Event Message Bundle.

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px" >
	<a href="images/messages/pds_birth_notification_bundle.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/messages/pds_birth_notification_bundle.png"></a>
	<p>PDS Birth Notification Bundle <a href="images/messages/pds_birth_notification_bundle.png" target="_blank">(open in new TAB)</a></p>
</div>

The focus of the PDS Birth Notification event message is the `CareConnect-Communication-1` resource. This indicates the Patient resource representing the mother, referenced via the event message Communication resource subject element. The baby in this birth notification is linked to the mother through the `CareConnect-RelatedPerson-1` resource which represents the relationship of mother to baby. Additional information about the birth is included in the bundle as observation resources which are either linked to the mother or the baby


## PDS Birth Notification Event Message Life Cycle ##

The birth notification event is triggered by a birth being registered on the Spine. The `PDS Birth Notification` event message will only be sent once by the Spine and the MessageHeader resource will contain a `eventMessageType` extension with value `new`. There will be no `update` or `delete` version of this event message.


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the PDS Birth Notification event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `BIRTHNOTIFICATION-1` |


## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance should be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the [Generic Requirements](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ems-beta/explore_genreic_event_requirements.html) page.
