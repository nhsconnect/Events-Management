summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the Blood Spot Test Outcome Event Message Bundle"
---


## Event Message Content

The `Blood Spot Test Outcome` event message represents a record of a blood spot test outcome in relation to a patient. Either creation, an update or deletion of the record.

 All "Blood Spot Test Outcome" event messages that are published to the NEMS **MUST** be created inline with guidance and requirements specified on this page and on the [Generic Event Message Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page. Where requirements on this page contradict the requirements on the Generic Event Message Requirements page, then the requirements on this page take precedence.


## Bundle Structure

The event message will contain a mandatory `MessageHeader` resource as the first element within the event message bundle as per FHIR messaging requirements. The MessageHeader resource references a `Encounter` resource as the focus of the event message. The bloodspot test procedures, results and comment are linked to this encounter focus resource within the event message.

The diagram below shows the referencing between FHIR resources within the event message bundle:

	<a href="images/messages/bloodspot_test_outcome_bundle.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/messages/bloodspot_test_outcome_bundle.png"></a>
</div>


## Event Life Cycle ##

The `MessageHeader` resource contains the `messageEventType` extension which represents the action the event message represents at a resource level, for example the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` being shared is new or has been updated, or the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` has been deleted. The `messageEventType` extension shall contain a values as per the table below:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| new | The `new` value must be used when the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` is being shared for the first time, or is being shared because of an `update` to the information. |
| update | A value of `update` **will not** be used for this type of event due to the way the Blood Spot Tests are recorded and managed within the current National Screening Service, a value of **new** shall be used instead. |
| delete | The `delete` value must be used when the Blood Spot Test Outcome record has been deleted and the record no longer exists. |


### Identifying Information

To support the event life cycle outlined above the following requirements MUST be followed:

- For `new` and `update` type event messages, all procedures, results and other information MUST be included within each of the event messages.

- The information included in the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` event message should be treated as atomic and stored under the `identifier` included within focus `CareConnect-Encounter-1` resource. Where a `new` type event message is received with the same `identifier` the previous information should be overwritten with the information in the later event message as identified by the `MessageHeader.meta.lastUpdated` element within the event message.

- In a `delete` type event message the event message should be populated with the payload of the original new (or update) message where possible, to allow for additional validation of the information being removed. Where this is not possible the event message SHALL including, as a minimum, the `MessageHeader` resource and the focus `CareConnect-Encounter-1` resource. It is important that the `CareConnect-Encounter-1` resource includes the relevant `identifier` element, as included in new (or update) event messages so the subscriber can identify the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` that the delete relates to.


### Message Sequencing

As the Blood Spot Test Outcome may change in the source system, this would be represented by multiple `new`, `new (update)` and `delete` type event messages being published. To allow a subscribers to perform message sequencing, the event MUST include the `meta.lastUpdated` element within the `MessageHeader` resource allowing the consumer to identify the latest and most up to date information.


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the `Blood Spot Test Outcome` event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `BLOODSPOTTESTOUTCOME_1` |


## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance must be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the [Generic Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.
