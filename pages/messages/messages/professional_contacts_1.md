## Event Message Content

The `Professional Contacts` event is a event message which represent a episode of care in which an organisation has or had a responsibility of care for a patient.

All "Professional Contacts" event messages that are published to the NEMS **MUST** be created inline with guidance and requirements specified on this page and on the [Generic Event Message Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.


## Bundle structure

The event message will contain a mandatory `MessageHeader` resource as the first element within the event message bundle as per FHIR messaging requirements. The MessageHeader resource references an `EpisodeOfCare` resource as the focus of the event message. The `EpisodeOfCare` resource represents the current status and the period in which the organisation is or was responsible for the patients care.


The diagram below shows the referencing between FHIR resources within the professional contacts event message bundle:

## Event Life Cycle ##

The information carried in a `Professional Contacts` event message must represent the `current` state of the organisations professional responsibility for a patient.

The contents of the `EpisodeOfCare` resource and its supporting resources conveys the current state of the organisations professional responsibility for the patient, such as if it is active, finished, cancelled, etc.

The `MessageHeader` resource contains the `messageEventType` extension which represents the action the event message represents at a resource level, for example the `EpisodeOfCare` being shared is new, the `EpisodeOfCare` or supporting resources have been updated or the `EpisodeOfCare` has been deleted. The `messageEventType` extension shall contain a values as per the table below:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| new |  The `new` value must be used when the EpisodeOfCare is being shared for the first time. |
| update | The `update` value must be used when the EpisodeOfCare and supporting resources have previously been shared, but have been updated and the updated resources are being shared. |
| delete | The `delete` value must be used when the EpisodeOfCare record has been delete and the record no longer exists. |

### Identifying Information

To allow subscribers to identify information between `new`, `update` and `delete` event messages the publisher must:

- publish a complete event message for all types, `new`, `update` and `delete`, not just the delta between the events
- included identifiers within resources which are maintained between different event messages

### Message Sequencing

As an organisations professional responsibility for a patient will change over time, the organisation will most likely publish multiple `professional contacts` events. To allow a consumer to perform message sequencing, the event MUST include the `meta.lastUpdated` element within the `MessageHeader` resource allowing the consumer to identify the latest and most up to date information.


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the `Professional Contacts` event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `PROFESSIONALCONTACTS_1` |


## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance must be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the [Generic Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.
