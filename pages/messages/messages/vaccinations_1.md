---

## Event Message Content

The `Vaccinations` event message represents a single vaccination given or not-given to a patient and any relevant supporting information.

All "Vaccinations" event messages that are published to the NEMS **MUST** be created inline with guidance and requirements specified on this page and on the [Generic Event Message Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.


## Bundle structure

The event message will contain a mandatory `MessageHeader` resource as the first element within the event message bundle as per FHIR messaging requirements. The MessageHeader resource references a `Immunization` resource as the focus of the event message. The `Immunization` represents the vaccination that was given or not given to the patient.


The diagram below shows the referencing between FHIR resources within the event message bundle:

</div>


## Event Life Cycle ##

The `MessageHeader` resource contains the `messageEventType` extension which represents the action the event message represents at a resource level, for example the `Vaccination` being shared is new, the `Vaccination` or supporting resources have been updated or the `Vaccination` has been deleted. The `messageEventType` extension shall contain a values as per the table below:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| new |  The `new` value must be used when the Vaccination is being shared for the first time. |
| update | The `update` value must be used when the Vaccination and supporting resources have previously been shared, but have been updated and the updated resources are being shared. |
| delete | The `delete` value must be used when the Vaccination record has been deleted and the record no longer exists. |

### Identifying Information

To allow subscribers to identify information between `new`, `update` and `delete` event messages the publisher must:

- publish a complete event message for all event types
- included identifiers within resources which are maintained between different event messages

### Message Sequencing

As vaccinations shared using the vaccinations event message may change and therefore `new`, `update` and `delete` types of the event are supported. To allow a consumer to perform message sequencing, the event MUST include the `meta.lastUpdated` element within the `MessageHeader` resource allowing the consumer to identify the latest and most up to date information.


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the `Vaccinations` event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `VACCINATIONS_1` |


## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance must be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the [Generic Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.
