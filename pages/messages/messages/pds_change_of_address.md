summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the PDS Change of Address event message bundle"
---

PDS Change of Address event messages are generated by the Spine and published to the NEMS when the `H (usual)` address of a patient is changed within their PDS record. The event message will contains the patients new address and their previous address as per the guidance below.


## Bundle structure

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px" >
	<a href="images/messages/change_of_address_bundle.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/messages/change_of_address_bundle.png"></a>
	PDS Change of Address Bundle <a href="images/messages/change_of_address_bundle.png" target="_blank">(open in new TAB)</a>
</div>

The `CareConnect-EMS-Patient-1` resource within the bundle will contain two addresses, one will represent the patient's old address and one will represent the patients new address and will be identifiable by the `use` element within the addresses.


## PDS Change of Address Message Life Cycle ##

The `PDS Change of Address` event message is always a `new` event and there is no concept of `update` or `delete` for the event message.

If a subscriber receives multiple `PDS Change of Address` event messages for the same patient, the latest event message as indicated by the `timestamp` element within the MessageHeader resource should be considered the source of truth for the patient's correct address.

{% include important.html content="`PDS Change of Address` event messages will only be triggered for updates to the patients home address on the Spine. Changes to a patient temporary address's on Spine will not trigger a `PDS Change of Address` event message to be sent through the EMS." %}


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the PDS Change of Address event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `CHILDHEALTH_CHANGEOFADDRESS_UPDATE` |
