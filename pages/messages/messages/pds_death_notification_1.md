summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the PDS Death Notification event message bundle"
---

PDS Death Notification event messages are generated by the Spine and published to the NEMS when a patient's death notification status is changed within PDS. The death notification status of the patient is carried within the event message as specified in the guidance on this page.

## Bundle structure

Specifies mandatory referencing within the Event Message Bundle.

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px" >
	<a href="images/messages/pds_death_bundle.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/messages/pds_death_bundle.png"></a>
	<p>PDS Death Notification Bundle <a href="images/messages/pds_death_bundle.png" target="_blank">(open in new TAB)</a></p>
</div>

The `extension(deathNotificationStatus)` and `deceasedDateTime` elements within the patient resource are the main indicators of the patient's death status.


## PDS Death Notification Event Message Types ##

The event message details send following an update to the patientâ€™s death notification status in PDS is outlined in the table below. The table is included to highlight the different types of Death Notification event message you may receive and the key elements within resource which help identify the type of Death Notification event message you have received. Additional guidance around the content of the FHIR resources is outlined in the `Resource population requirements and guidance` section below.

The different types of death status change in PDS are: 

- **Informal death** - an administrative flag has been set by a Spine user in order to provide an early indication that a patient is believed to have died, prior to a death certificate being issued for them, in case organisations wish to supress communications to these patients and/or cancel their appointments.
- **Formal death** - where a death certificate has been issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths and the death has been notified to Spine via the Office for National Statistics (ONS), or where a maternity unit has recorded a still birth.
- **Death status removed** - There are scenarios where a PDS record may be updated with a death status in error, where this happens the death status can be removed.


|  | Informal death | Formal death | Death Notification Status removed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Event-MessageHeader-1 Resource** |
| `extension(messageEventType)` | Fixed value: `new` | Fixed value: `new` | Fixed value: `new` |
| `event` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` |
| **CareConnect-Communication-1 Resource** |
| `status` | Fixed value: `completed` | Fixed value: `completed` | Fixed value: `completed` |
| **CareConnect-Patient-1 Resource** |
| `extension(deathNotificationStatus)` | Fixed value: 1 (Informal) | Fixed value: 2 (Formal) | Fixed value: U (Removed) |
| `deceasedDateTime` | element populated with dateTime of death | element populated with dateTime of death | **element not included in resource** |


If a subscriber receives multiple `PDS Death Notification` event messages for the same patient, the latest event message as indicated by the `meta.lastUpdated` element within the MessageHeader resource should be considered the source of truth for the deathNotificationStatus element. This is the specific dateTime on which the deathNotificationStatus element was updated on PDS.



## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the PDS Death Notification event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `DEATHNOTIFICATION_1` |


## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance should be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the [Generic Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.


### [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)

The Bundle resource is the container for the event message and SHALL conform to the [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle) FHIR profile.

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | 1..1 | Fixed value: `message` |


### [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://simplifier.net/Messaging/Event-MessageHeader-1)

The MessageHeader resource included as part of the event message SHALL conform to the [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://simplifier.net/Messaging/Event-MessageHeader-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| meta.lastUpdated | 1..1 | DateTime when the patient record was updated with the details included in this event message. This element should be used for message sequencing |
| extension(messageEventType) | 1..1 | Will be populated as per the event life cycle table above. |
| event | 1..1 | Fixed Value: pds-death-notification-1 (PDS Death Notification) |
| focus | 1..1 | This will reference the "CareConnect-Communication-1" resource which contains information relating to the event message. |


### [CareConnect-Communication-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Communication-1)

The Communication resource included in the event message SHALL conform to the [CareConnect-Communication-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Communication-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | 1..1 | Fixed value: `completed` |
| sender | 0..1 | This will reference the sending organization of the event message.<br/> For PDS events this will be a reference to a CareConnect-Organization-1 resource within the message bundle. **\***|
| subject | 1..1 | This will reference the patient resource representing the patient who is the subject of this event. |


### [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Patient-1)

The patient resource included in the event message SHALL conform to the [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Patient-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:

| Resource Cardinality | 1..1 |

| Element | Cardinality | Additional Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| meta.versionId | 1..1 | This element will contain the serial change number (SCN) of the patient record within Spine at the time this event was published. |
| extension(deathNotificationStatus) | 1..1 | This will be populated as per the event life cycle table above. |
| extension(systemEffectiveDate) | 1..1 | Element populated with dateTime when Death Notification Status was updated on the Spine. |
| deceasedDateTime | 0..1 | This will be populated as per the event life cycle table above. |





### [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Organization-1)

The Organization resource(s) included in the event message SHALL conform to the [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3/CareConnect-Organization-1) constrained FHIR profile and the additional population guidance as per the table below:
