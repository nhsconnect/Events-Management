   A birth can be registered on PDS without the mothers details, including her NHS Number. Previously the publication of these birth registrations as a `PDS Birth Notification` event messages resulted in an invalid event message being sent to subscribers. The `PDS Birth Notification` event message has been updated to support birth registrations without the mothers details, through relaxation of the cardinalities within some resources. Changes have been made to the `routingDemographic` extension in the `MessageHeader` resource and within the `Patient` resource representing the mother.
   
   For `PDS Birth Notification` event messages where there is no NHS number for the mother, these event messages will only be sent to subscribers who have a geographic based generic subscription and will not be sent to subscribers based on an explicit subscription.
